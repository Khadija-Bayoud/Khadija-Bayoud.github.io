Hello! My name is Khadija, and Iâ€™m passionate about integrating Data Science and Machine Learning across various industries. I have a state diploma of Engineer in Artificial Intelligence with an evolving background in machine learning and deep learning.
I am currently working as a Data Scientist (more details in my resume).<br><br>

I am a lifelong learner and I believe in balancing theory with practice.  As part of this journey, I inspire colleagues through monthly meetings where we work on projects, share knowledge, and collaborate in a supportive environment.<br><br>

I am always eager to connect with others who are interested in learning together and exchanging ideas about AI projects and experiences.<br><br>

If you enjoy learning together through structured, monthly meetings that include exciting projects, feel free to contact me at <strong>khadijabayoud.me@gmail.com</strong>!

Here is some of my favorite sources of information :
  - [AI By Hand](https://aibyhand.substack.com/) where Professor **Tom Yeh** showcases how calculations are performed in neural networks.
  - [Paper With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) where I find links to research papers and their implementations.
  - [Jay Alammar](https://www.youtube.com/@arp_ai) youtube channel.
  - [Umar Jamil](https://www.youtube.com/@umarjamilai) youtube channel.

#### **Overview** ‚≠ê
La Chaire Unesco Pratiques √©mergentes des technologies et communication pour le d√©veloppement at Bordeaux Montaigne University launched the 2nd edition of the web documentary challenge on artificial intelligence (AI in Africa) in 2023, which invites student teams from African higher education institutions to compete with short films centered around this theme.

My team and I focused on showcasing Moroccan initiatives to promote the use of artificial intelligence through support for higher education, investment, and youth empowerment.

Our film title **L'IA pour tous** translates to **AI for All** emphasizes the inclusive and accessible nature of artificial intelligence suggesting a vision where AI is not just a technological advancement for the privileged but a tool that can benefit everyone. We named our team **AI Seeds** to reflect the idea of planting the seeds of knowledge and innovation, nurturing growth and potential in the era of artificial intelligence across Morocco and Africa.

Here is a link to our film on youtube [AI Seeds Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHRCbBS-vl4&list=PL8CMWTcQuwgnze5NJD2tCrSQdLwjAQPfU&index=2):
